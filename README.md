# LSU_Seed_Counting_Hardware
# Project Overview
This repository contains 3D-printed hardware to assist with counting oyster seed in a nursery. The hardware is meant to be used in combination with the seed counting software found here: [https://github.com/LSU-Devision/GUI/releases] (https://github.com/LSU-Devision/GUI/releases). This project aims to automate the counting of oyster seeds using image recognition to increase accuracy and efficiency. The software component creates a robust image segmentation program that can accurately count oyster seeds, replacing the current manual counting methods used in research labs. The hardware component provides physical devices to assist with capturing high quality images and sampling seed consistently. The hardware and software were developed by Louisiana Sea Grant (under the guidance of Dr. Sarah Bodenstein and Dr. Elizabeth Robinson) with collaboration from the Oyster Team at the LSU Department of Mathematics during the 2024 and 2025 school years.
