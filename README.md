# LSU_Seed_Counting_Hardware
# Project Overview
This repository contains 3D-printed hardware to assist with counting oyster seed at the nursery stage. This hardware is meant to be used in combination with the seed counting software found here: [https://github.com/LSU-Devision/GUI/releases](https://github.com/LSU-Devision/GUI/releases). Through the use of open-source technology, this project aimed to increase the accuracy and efficiency of counting oyster seed. The software component creates an image segmentation program that can accurately count oyster seed, replacing manual counting methods. The hardware component provides physical devices to assist with consistently capturing high-quality images for software analysis.
